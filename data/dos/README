All Fake86 release version numbers are simply based on the date
I released it, in this format: 0.year.month.day

So just look for the most recent version based on that of course.
All releases will include the standard source tarball (*.tar.gz)
as well as a pre-compiled binary version for Win32. (*.zip)

I may also throw a pre-compiled .deb for i386 and amd64 Debian
and Ubuntu users for some versions.

dos-boot.zip contains a single 1.44 MB floppy disk image that
can be used by Fake86. It has MS-DOS 6.22, and a small subset of
the tools from it that can used to partition, format, and make
bootable a new blank hard drive image. (fdisk, format, sys, etc)

There was room left on the disk, so I also included the old
freeware game Jetpack from the early 1990's.

After unzipping the disk image, you can boot it in Fake86 by
using this command:

fake86 -fd0 dos-boot.img


fake86-packet-driver.zip includes a standard DOS packet driver
that can be used inside Fake86 to use networked DOS applications
if using Fake86 with network emulation support.
